I highly recommend this approach because</p><ul><li>The liked materials are directly related to the questions in the renewal exam</li><li>The Microsoft Learn materials and labs are very well made, up to date and relevant</li></ul><p>During the renewal exam, without a proctor or dedicated app, nothing prevents you from navigating back to the learning materials or searching for the answers online. While this approach might work to renew the certification, I think that misses the point. I think going through the materials preparing for the exam, and then consciously answering the exam questions fulfills the &ldquo;brush up on your skills&rdquo; objective in the invitation email.</p><p>About the individual exams, what I found is that all the topics are covered in the learning materials and a lot of the topics from the original exams are not part of the renewal. The questions are less &ldquo;tricky&rdquo; than in the proctored exams and all the questions are multiple selections, no labs, no &ldquo;order the commands&rdquo; or any other of the question types available in the proctored exams.</p><h1 id=see-more>See More</h1><p>Something that happened to me while preparing for the DevOps exam, opening the links to the learning materials, is that I missed some of the materials. While doing the exam I got some questions for which I wasn&rsquo;t prepared, then after the exam I went back to the page and noticed the &ldquo;See More&rdquo; link at the bottom of the list of training materials, same link is present in the Architect Expert exam, and I learned my lesson.</p><h1 id=celebrate>Celebrate</h1><p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2021/celebrate.png alt=&ldquo;Celebrate&rdquo; title=Celebrate></p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>The content on this site reflect my personal views</p>©
