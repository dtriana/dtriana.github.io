<p>That email subject, from May 21, asked for action, to get one of my certifications renewed, or &ldquo;If your certification expires, you must earn the certification again by passing the required certification exam(s)&rdquo;</p>
<p>This renewal process is <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/renew-your-microsoft-certification>new in many ways</a>, main differences are</p>
<ul>
<li>The topics covered are not necessarily the same as for the original exam/certification</li>
<li>The exam itself is simpler than the proctored exam, no proctor, no dedicated exam app</li>
</ul>
<p>I renewed 3 certifications with this process,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-developer/renew/>Azure Developer Associate</a></li>
<li><a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/devops-engineer/renew/>DevOps Engineer Expert</a></li>
<li><a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/renew/>Azure Solutions Architect Expert</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I passed all on the first try, however the renewal exams can be repeated as many times as needed</p>
<p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2021/exams.png alt=&ldquo;Exams&rdquo; title=Exams></p>
<p>To prepare, I went through all the linked materials on each of the certification pages, all of which go to the Microsoft Learn site, and include theory, labs and exam. I highly recommend this approach because</p>
<ul>
<li>The liked materials are directly related to the questions in the renewal exam</li>
<li>The Microsoft Learn materials and labs are very well made, up to date and relevant</li>
</ul>
<p>During the renewal exam, without a proctor or dedicated app, nothing prevents you from navigating back to the learning materials or searching for the answers online. While this approach might work to renew the certification, I think that misses the point. I think going through the materials preparing for the exam, and then consciously answering the exam questions fulfills the &ldquo;brush up on your skills&rdquo; objective in the invitation email.</p>
<p>About the individual exams, what I found is that all the topics are covered in the learning materials and a lot of the topics from the original exams are not part of the renewal. The questions are less &ldquo;tricky&rdquo; than in the proctored exams and all the questions are multiple selections, no labs, no &ldquo;order the commands&rdquo; or any other of the question types available in the proctored exams.</p>

<p>Something that happened to me while preparing for the DevOps exam, opening the links to the learning materials, is that I missed some of the materials. While doing the exam I got some questions for which I wasn&rsquo;t prepared, then after the exam I went back to the page and noticed the &ldquo;See More&rdquo; link at the bottom of the list of training materials, same link is present in the Architect Expert exam, and I learned my lesson.</p>
