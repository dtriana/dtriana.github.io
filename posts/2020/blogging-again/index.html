Until today I had my blog on (<a href=https://wordpress.com>https://wordpress.com</a>), the free tier, and while that worked I really prefer to have more control, and specially having everything from my own domain instead of a redirect (not that itâ€™s not possible on wordpress.com, just not on the free tier).</p><p>Last month, to setup my <a href=https://loracer.co>sonâ€™s website</a>, I spent some time researching on platforms, CMS, static generators and similar technologies, and something really stuck with me, about the advantages of an static site from <a href=https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/static-site-generator-build-better-blog>this Pluralsight course</a>.</p><p>With that in mind, I started researching alternatives, starting on the <a href=https://www.staticgen.com/>great information available here</a>, I tried <a href=https://nextjs.org/>Next.JS</a>, <a href=http://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a> and <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. By trying, I mean I set those up, created a basic blog, setup a theme, added a post, and explored how to setup CI/CD, and finally decided on Hugo.</p><p>While <a href=https://gohugo.io/documentation/>the documentation</a> is not that good, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3">the YouTube videos</a> are great, very well organized, and the <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/>available themes</a>, most of which are free, are great. Setting up CI/CD was very easy with <a href=https://help.github.com/en/actions>GitHub actions</a> and documenting my boyâ€™s racing career became as easy as I wanted it.</p><p>Now, about my blog, migrating the WordPress content to Hugo was easy enough, since WordPress allows to export all the content including images, and then converting the exported blog posts to Hugoâ€™s md was done by using <a href=https://github.com/palaniraja/blog2md>this script</a>.</p><p>After a couple of hours adjusting links and images, it was all set, hosted on <a href=https://pages.github.com/>GitHub pages</a>, and ready to re-start adding blog posts, so letâ€™s do it!</p></div><footer></footer></article><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script type=text/javascript async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/startup.js id=MathJax-script></script><script>MathJax={tex:{inlineMath:[['$','$'],['\\(','\\)']],processEscapes:true,processEnvironments:true},options:{skipHtmlTags:['script','noscript','style','textarea','pre']}};</script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>The content on this site reflect my personal views</p>Â©
