      <div>
        
        <p>I have been using Linux more and more, via WSL, and learning a lot along the way.</p>
<p>Part of the jorney is breaking and fixing things, which is exactly what happened to me today.</p>
<p>I was trying to get the very nice command prompt, like the one from <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToMakeAPrettyPromptInWindowsTerminalWithPowerlineNerdFontsCascadiaCodeWSLAndOhmyposh.aspx" title="Scott Hanselman's post about pretty prompts">Scott Hanselman</a>, and at some point following different steps from the ones shared by Scott I installed zsh as my shell.</p>
<p>After trying the zsh approach and not being able to make it work, I decided to revert, and stick to what Scott did, so first thing was removing zsh,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">sudo apt-get remove zsh
</code></pre></div><p>And then when trying to get the prompt again all I got back was</p>
<p><a href="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/74581889-deaed800-4fef-11ea-9da4-af11872473e2.png"><img src="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/74581889-deaed800-4fef-11ea-9da4-af11872473e2.png" alt="process exited with code 1" title="process exited with code 1"></a></p>
<p>Very bad</p>
<p>A similar <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4899#issuecomment-658973402">GitHub issue</a> provided some tips, none of which fixed my problem, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4899#issuecomment-631976826">this particular comment</a> set me in the right path, by running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">wsl --user root
</code></pre></div><p>With it I was able to get the bash prompt back, and from there try to fix whatever was broken. Since something was failing while starting the shell, after removing zsh, I looked into the .bashrc and .zshrc files, removed them, but no change.</p>
<p>Then a response to my comment on github cleared everything up, &ldquo;either apt install zsh or modify your users shell with chsh&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I was able to interact as root, since root was still using bash, but my user was still configured to use zsh, and since I removed it that&rsquo;s why it wasn&rsquo;t working, and to change the shell? That&rsquo;s where the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/unix/chsh.htm">chsh command</a> comes to the rescue.</p>
<p>So running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">chsh -s /bin/bash myLinuxUsername
</code></pre></div><p>Fixed the bash prompt</p>
<p>Now, back to customizing the prompt but without zsh, I revisited Scott&rsquo;s post, and then I needed to add some lines to the .bashrc file, but I deleted that one while troubleshooting earlier.</p>
<p>Luckily I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/5d9hhe/can_someone_please_paste_the_content_the_default/da3bv2i/">this reddit comment</a></p>
<p>And sure enough, the default .bashrc was available at /etc/skel so I just went there and did a</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">cp .bashrc ~/
</code></pre></div><p>And back on track to get my prompt as fancy as Scott&rsquo;s, and of course back at being productive with WSL.</p>
