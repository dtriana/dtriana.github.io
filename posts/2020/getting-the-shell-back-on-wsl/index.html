</code></pre><p>And then when trying to get the prompt again all I got back was</p><p><a href=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/74581889-deaed800-4fef-11ea-9da4-af11872473e2.png><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/74581889-deaed800-4fef-11ea-9da4-af11872473e2.png alt="process exited with code 1" title="process exited with code 1"></a></p><p>Very bad</p><p>A similar <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4899#issuecomment-658973402>GitHub issue</a> provided some tips, none of which fixed my problem, but <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4899#issuecomment-631976826>this particular comment</a> set me in the right path, by running</p><pre tabindex=0><code>wsl --user root
</code></pre><p>With it I was able to get the bash prompt back, and from there try to fix whatever was broken. Since something was failing while starting the shell, after removing zsh, I looked into the .bashrc and .zshrc files, removed them, but no change.</p><p>Then a response to my comment on github cleared everything up, &ldquo;either apt install zsh or modify your users shell with chsh&rdquo;</p><p>So I was able to interact as root, since root was still using bash, but my user was still configured to use zsh, and since I removed it that&rsquo;s why it wasn&rsquo;t working, and to change the shell? That&rsquo;s where the <a href=https://www.computerhope.com/unix/chsh.htm>chsh command</a> comes to the rescue.</p><p>So running</p><pre tabindex=0><code>chsh -s /bin/bash myLinuxUsername
</code></pre><p>Fixed the bash prompt</p><p>Now, back to customizing the prompt but without zsh, I revisited Scott&rsquo;s post, and then I needed to add some lines to the .bashrc file, but I deleted that one while troubleshooting earlier.</p><p>Luckily I found <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/5d9hhe/can_someone_please_paste_the_content_the_default/da3bv2i/>this reddit comment</a></p><p>And sure enough, the default .bashrc was available at /etc/skel so I just went there and did a</p><pre tabindex=0><code>cp .bashrc ~/
</code></pre><p>And back on track to get my prompt as fancy as Scott&rsquo;s, and of course back at being productive with WSL.</p></div><footer></footer></article><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-R4558gYOUz8mP9YWpZJjofhk+zx0AS11p36HnD2ZKj/6JR5z27gSSULCNHIRReVs crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-z1fJDqw8ZApjGO3/unPWUPsIymfsJmyrDVWC8Tv/a1HeOtGmkwNd/7xUS0Xcnvsx crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+XBljXPPiv+OzfbB3cVmLHf4hdUFHlWNZN5spNQ7rmHTXpd7WvJum6fIACpNNfIR crossorigin=anonymous onload='renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1},{left:"\\(",right:"\\)",display:!1},{left:"\\[",right:"\\]",display:!0}]})'></script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
