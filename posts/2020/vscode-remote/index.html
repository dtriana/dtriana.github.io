A great discussion about it is available <a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1708">here</a>.</p><p>The specific scenarios for which this technology is a great time saver for me are:</p><h4 id=build-environments-isolation>Build environments isolation
<a class=heading-link href=#build-environments-isolation><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>Different projects have different needs, and often those needs collide, different version, different system configurations. With this technology I can have a specific remote for linux-phyton, linux-go, linux-dotnetcore, or even more specific, by version or project, having a trusted build environment for that specific need</p><h4 id=high-bandwidth-requirements>High bandwidth requirements
<a class=heading-link href=#high-bandwidth-requirements><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h4><p>Living outside the city has many adventages, but broadband is not one of them, so if my productivity depends on downloading several docker images, pushing containers, or having very good connectivity in general, then I&rsquo;m not productive, however with this technology all of that happens on the remote, where the bandwith is not a problem</p><h2 id=setting-it-up>Setting it up
<a class=heading-link href=#setting-it-up><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>While the steps to set this up are already documented <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh-tutorial>here</a>, this blog post goes over some of the details to make it work. For this, I created a new environment, on the client side I created a new Windows 10 Pro VM, and for the remote, a CentOS VM, both in Azure. Of course the idea of the client is to use your own computer, I created a new VM to see it work from scratch and being able to document all the steps.</p><p>I created the Windows VM from the portal in a new resource group called remotevs, for the Linux VM I used Azure CLI from the cloud shell in the portal:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>az vm create --resource-group remotevs --name remotevsserver --image OpenLogic:CentOS:7.7:7.7.2020062400 --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
</code></pre><p>Here I used the CentOS image just because I&rsquo;m studying for the Linux Foundation certification, any other image should work fine as happens with the one I use to build this blog which is based in Ubuntu.</p><p>Once the VMs were running I opened a remote desktop session on the Windows machine, and installed Visual Studio Code. Right after that I clicked on the link to get the SSH Extension, and got it installed on VSCode</p><p><a href=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/vscode-remote-extension.png><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/vscode-remote-extension.png alt="VSCode Remote SSH Extension" title="VSCode Remote SSH Extension"></a></p><p>The documentation indicates that an SSH Client is needed on the client, and links to <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse>OpenSSH for Windows</a>, which can be added via the user interface or via PowerShell, which I did</p><p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/admin-powershellpng.png alt="&ldquo;Opening powershell as admin&rdquo;" title="Opening powershell as admin"></p><pre tabindex=0><code>Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
</code></pre><p>And now what is missing is the SSH Key. In the documentation, it is suggested to first create a key pair, and then use that public key during the virtual machine creation. That certainly works, the way I did it however, with the generate-ssh-keys parameter, means that the public and private keys are there in the cloud shell. I need to copy those keys to the client for the authentication to work.</p><p>To copy the files, I opened a cloud shell again, this time on the client machine, found the files, and then copy using the download command</p><p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/copyssh.png alt="Copying files from cloud shell" title="Copying files from cloud shell"></p><p>And now move them in the client file system to the expected location</p><p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/copysshpowershell.png alt="Moving files to ssh folder" title="Moving files to ssh folder"></p><p>The name id_rsa is a default name, and if this is your client machine you might already have one. Its fine to rename it, but the filename will need to be passed explicitly to the ssh command, and also be set explicitly in the VSCode configuration.</p><p>If the add-ssh command fails with</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory
</code></pre><p>Its because the ssh-agent service is not running. To start it in PowerShell</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
Start-Service ssh-agent
</code></pre><p>As described <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement>here</a></p><p>With the private key in place is time for a test</p><p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/sshtest.png alt="SSH Connection Test" title="SSH Connection Test"></p><p>And now that I know my client is able to SSH to the remote, its time for VSCode to do the same</p><p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/codeconnect.png alt="Connection dialog in VSCode" title="Connection dialog in VSCode"></p><p><img src=https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2020/connecttestvscode.png alt="VSCode and terminal connected" title="VSCode and terminal connected"></p><p>In case the private key file has a different name, as happens to me with the one for the blog, the connection will fail and the extension will allow to edit the configuration, which is a text file. On that text file, you can provide the path and name of the private key file, in my case for example:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Host hugoblog
  HostName hugoblog
  User azureuser
  ForwardAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/hugoblog
</code></pre><h1 id=next-steps>Next steps
<a class=heading-link href=#next-steps><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Depending on the purpose of the remote you will need to apt-get update, configure git, install dotnet core, install python, install Azure CLI &mldr;</p><p>And something that works without explicit configuration is port forwarding, in the case of my blog I can browse it locally, as if it was running locally but in realilty is being port-forwarded from the remote. This works with dotnet core as well.</p><p>Have fun!</p></div><footer></footer></article><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-R4558gYOUz8mP9YWpZJjofhk+zx0AS11p36HnD2ZKj/6JR5z27gSSULCNHIRReVs crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-z1fJDqw8ZApjGO3/unPWUPsIymfsJmyrDVWC8Tv/a1HeOtGmkwNd/7xUS0Xcnvsx crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+XBljXPPiv+OzfbB3cVmLHf4hdUFHlWNZN5spNQ7rmHTXpd7WvJum6fIACpNNfIR crossorigin=anonymous onload='renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1},{left:"\\(",right:"\\)",display:!1},{left:"\\[",right:"\\]",display:!0}]})'></script></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
