&lt;p>With the iPhone 5 and it’s nano SIMCARD I found myself with a small form size dilemma:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2015/05/image.png">&lt;img src="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2015/05/image_thumb.png" alt="image" title="Sim Cards Sizes">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The iPhone uses nano, the Nokia micro and sometimes I need a full simcard so I started using small plastic adapters as my “&lt;strong>solution&lt;/strong>”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2015/05/Annotation.jpg" alt="Plastic Sim Card" title="Plastic Sim Card">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What seemed like a good idea at first turned out to be the &lt;strong>Nokia 920 Killer&lt;/strong>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Nokia 920 is a very delicate piece of engineering, in which the mechanism that holds the SIMCARD in place is specifically designed for micro SIMCARDS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two times when I used the adapter it felt a little forced when removing the SIMCARD, the third time it was really difficult. Well, that third time broke the mechanism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I brought the phone to the local Nokia shop and they returned as irreparable, claiming that the broken part wasn’t available as a replacement since it was part of the whole phone mainboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2015/05/image1.png">&lt;img src="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2015/05/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" title="Broken Pin">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later a sad reality in life revealed to me: The guys in those shops, not just Nokia but Apple and everyone else are not there to help you repair your &lt;em>old&lt;/em> electronics but to help you make the decision to buy a new one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That reality was very clear later when trying to get the guys at the Apple shop to replace an internal battery for an iPad. They had ready a very compelling speech of why it was better for me, mankind and the whole universe to just buy a new one …&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind I searched the web for the part and there it was, U$1.90 !!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.parts4repair.com/sim-contact-for-nokia-lumia-920-900-800-n9-c5-03-5250/" title="http://www.parts4repair.com/sim-contact-for-nokia-lumia-920-900-800-n9-c5-03-5250/">http://www.parts4repair.com/sim-contact-for-nokia-lumia-920-900-800-n9-c5-03-5250/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>International shipping was U$6 !!! and it got here in less than 2 weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took care myself of disassembling the phone following one of the many youtube videos,  then I brought the phone to a small local electronics shop, they charged me U$ 10 for desoldering the broken part and soldering the new one, an guest what? GOOD AS NEW!!!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google 2nd Step Verification and Windows Phone 8</title><link>https://davidtriana.com/posts/2012/google-2nd-step-verification-and-windows-phone-8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2013 17:48:14 +0000</pubDate><author>david@davidtriana.com (David Triana)</author><guid>https://davidtriana.com/posts/2012/google-2nd-step-verification-and-windows-phone-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m moving from iOS 6 (iPhone 4) to Windows Phone 8 (HTC 8x).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the apps I’m missing from iOS is the Google Authenticator that provides one time passwords to authenticate to google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looked around and found the Authenticator application:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/82c12390-0176-43de-916e-5613d17f61a0?wa=wsignin1.0" title="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/82c12390-0176-43de-916e-5613d17f61a0?wa=wsignin1.0">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/82c12390-0176-43de-916e-5613d17f61a0?wa=wsignin1.0&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recommended on the Karspersky blog&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Immediately installed it, then proceeded to Google to configure it. As expected Google doesn’t offer Windows Phone as an option since them don’t produce an app for that:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2013/01/image.png">&lt;img src="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2013/01/image_thumb.png" alt="image" title="image">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I leave the setting on iPhone and run the App.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The barcode scanner doesn’t seem to work, at least not as easy as it was on the iPhone, I ended up entering the code using the “Can’t Scan the barcode” option from Google&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2013/01/image1.png">&lt;img src="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2013/01/image_thumb1.png" alt="image" title="image">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Entered the code in the app&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2013/01/wp_ss_20130111_0001.jpg">&lt;img src="https://davidtriana.com/images/posts/2013/01/wp_ss_20130111_0001_thumb.jpg" alt="wp_ss_20130111_0001" title="wp_ss_20130111_0001">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And voila&lt;/p>
