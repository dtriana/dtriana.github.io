      <description>I frequently move my SIMCARD from phone to phone, testing applications, OS features and things like that.
With the iPhone 5 and it’s nano SIMCARD I found myself with a small form size dilemma:

The iPhone uses nano, the Nokia micro and sometimes I need a full simcard so I started using small plastic adapters as my “solution”
What seemed like a good idea at first turned out to be the Nokia 920 Killer!</description>

      <description>I’m moving from iOS 6 (iPhone 4) to Windows Phone 8 (HTC 8x).
One of the apps I’m missing from iOS is the Google Authenticator that provides one time passwords to authenticate to google.
Looked around and found the Authenticator application:

Immediately installed it, then proceeded to Google to configure it. As expected Google doesn’t offer Windows Phone as an option since them don’t produce an app for that:</description>
