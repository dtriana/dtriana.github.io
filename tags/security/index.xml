      <description>A few weeks ago a friend called me, very worried, about a threatening email he is receiving, someone claiming to have access to his email, threatening to release some compromising information, sharing part of his email password as proof, and asking for a ransom to be paid via Bitcoin. The password was in fact a password he used in the past, or maybe for a different site, not his current email password, but still he was very worried on how this happened.</description>
