      <description>Scenario Some workitems are missing important information, the information was provided via an Excel sheet, the workitems need to be updated with this information without changing any other properties, particularly the workitem state.
Restrictions The workitems are in done state, and the process template has rules that prevent changes to the properties that need to be updated.
The Excel integration, which might be a solution, is not working on this environment because of a permissions error.</description>
