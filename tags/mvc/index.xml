      <description>Frequently is very desirable that the request and the pages served to the user from the Web Application are delivered under https. Why?, because otherwise the data is transmitted in plain text over the wire or over the air if using WiFi and can be intercepted by other people.
How hard it will be to intercept the data? trivial to a motivated attacker, oppressive government or dedicated law enforcement agency. In fact, lately is trivial to anyone with tools like firesheepand other ready to use and easily available software.</description>

      <description>Last night I was setting up a new box for a web site migration and lost a lot of time with that 3 issues.
I used Web Platform Installer to setup most of the server hoping that it will leave everything working as expected, however I found that is not the case.
First I needed to setup the Web Deploy service to install the web application from visual studio, however the Web Platform Installer leaves a few things missing when it deals with the Web Deploy.</description>
