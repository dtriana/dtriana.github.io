      <description>Scenario Some workitems are missing important information, the information was provided via an Excel sheet, the workitems need to be updated with this information without changing any other properties, particularly the workitem state.
Restrictions The workitems are in done state, and the process template has rules that prevent changes to the properties that need to be updated.
The Excel integration, which might be a solution, is not working on this environment because of a permissions error.</description>

      <description>TFSPreview, the Team Foundation on the cloud offered by Microsoft is a very good alternative, specially for distributed development teams.
It’s currently free and invite only but the invite codes are relatively easy to get. I asked for one in the page and got it in two days.

Account activated, TFS available but what about my existing projects in my local TFS?,
The official word is that there’s no supported way to migrate, but, there’re some reports of success using the TFS Integration tools, well, I’m about to confirm or deny that reports!</description>
