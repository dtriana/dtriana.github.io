      <description>This are the podcast i&amp;rsquo;m currently listening / viewing. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what is a podcast i&amp;rsquo;m sure wikipedia explains it but basically are like radio / TV shows that i download to my computer and take with me on an iPod or other device to enjoy them where and when i like to.
I listen to the audio podcasts when i commute to my work and when i workout in the gym.</description>
