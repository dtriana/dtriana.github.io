If you don&rsquo;t know what is a podcast i&rsquo;m sure wikipedia explains it but basically are like radio / TV shows that i download to my computer and take with me on an iPod or other device to enjoy them where and when i like to.</p><p>I listen to the audio podcasts when i commute to my work and when i workout in the gym.</p><p>I watch the video podcasts at work in my lunch time. Since i don&rsquo;t go out to take my lunch, i enjoy my MRP Shake in company of one or two shows.</p><p>Before i got my iPhone i consume the audiopodcast on a cellphone or an standard iPod and the videopodcasts on the laptop. Now with the iPhone i enjoy both flavors with the same device.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve tried a couple replacements to iTunes but i keep coming back and with the iPhone there&rsquo;s no options.</p><p><a href=http://www.crankygeeks.com/>Cranky Geeks (Video)</a><br>Like diggnation but with cranks. Actually this show&rsquo;s dynamic is a little different as the main host, John, invites very good co-hosts each show. The show is very funny.</p><p><a href=http://www.revision3.com/diggnation>Diggnation (Video)</a><br>This is the first podcast i subscribed to and until now never stoped downloading and enjoying. This guys are very funny and when i hear them talking is like they are my friends.</p><p><a href=http://dl.tv>DL.TV (Video)</a><br>Not the same since Patrick left, but still good. This is another tech show, they review products, show how to do things, recommend software and answer technical questions.</p><p><a href=http://www.formulapod.com>Formulapod</a><br>After the races and some qualis, this guys make me laught a lot with their funny comments about Ralf, Culthard, Hami and all the stuff that happens in Formula 1.</p><p><a href=http://twit.tv/sn>Security Now</a><br>Steve Gibson knows what he is talking about. Security is his field and he talks about networks, windows, the web, passwords, PINs. Very good, very up to date, very technical when needed.</p><p><a href=http://www.revision3.com/trs>The totally rad show (Video)</a><br>About all the things RAD. They talk about the latest movies, games, tv shows, sometimes books, sometimes comics. The show is a little long so i generally skip the latest section (mail, forums, others) but i really enjoy their movies and games reviews.</p><p><a href=http://www.twis.org>This week in science</a><br>Latest news in science, commented by the brillant Dr. Kirsten and the funny Justin. Very good interviews also.</p><p><a href=http://www.twit.tv/twit>This week in tech</a><br>Tech news commented by the best guys in town. Fun, informative, dynamic &mldr; , love it.</p><p><a href=http://www.tikibartv.com>Tikibar (Video)</a><br>This one is really hard to explain. You need to check it out by yourself. The thruth is i&rsquo;m still trying to understand it.</p><p><a href=http://www.twit.tv/ww>Windows Weekly</a><br>The latests in the Microsoft land, but this guys talk about everything, even Mac!!!, i love their points of view, their experiences with operating systems, gaming consoles and devices in general.</p></article></section><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-R4558gYOUz8mP9YWpZJjofhk+zx0AS11p36HnD2ZKj/6JR5z27gSSULCNHIRReVs crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-z1fJDqw8ZApjGO3/unPWUPsIymfsJmyrDVWC8Tv/a1HeOtGmkwNd/7xUS0Xcnvsx crossorigin=anonymous></script><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.1/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js integrity=sha384-+XBljXPPiv+OzfbB3cVmLHf4hdUFHlWNZN5spNQ7rmHTXpd7WvJum6fIACpNNfIR crossorigin=anonymous onload='renderMathInElement(document.body,{delimiters:[{left:"$$",right:"$$",display:!0},{left:"$",right:"$",display:!1},{left:"\\(",right:"\\)",display:!1},{left:"\\[",right:"\\]",display:!0}]})'></script></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
